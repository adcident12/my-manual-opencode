## Grill me — complements superpowers brainstorming, doesn't duplicate it

This setup also runs the `superpowers` plugin. Its `brainstorming` skill is
the primary gate before creative work (new features, new subsystems,
behavior changes) — it already classifies scope, asks clarifying
questions, proposes approaches, and for bounded/architectural work writes
a spec under `docs/superpowers/specs/` before any implementation plan.
Do not add a second gate on top of it: if brainstorming has already run
(or is running) for a piece of work, do not also invoke `grilling` as a
separate pre-check for that same work.

Use `grilling` in exactly two situations instead:

1. **Inside** brainstorming's "ask clarifying questions" step: instead of
   asking one question at a time, batch the current frontier into
   `grilling`'s round format — numbered questions with a recommended
   answer each, resolved via the design-tree/frontier method — then fold
   the answers back into the brainstorming flow. This is a formatting
   upgrade to that one step, not a separate skill invocation cycle.
2. **Standalone**, outside any SDD/brainstorming flow: when the user
   explicitly wants to stress-test an idea or decision quickly (e.g. says
   "grill me about X"), with no spec file produced — this is a
   spike-level conversation, not project planning.

When a `grilling` round needs a fact from the codebase rather than a
user decision, look it up yourself inline before asking: if the project
has a `graft/` index, run `graft ask "<question>"` first; otherwise fall
back to grep or reading files directly. Only dispatch a sub-agent for it
if one is available and the lookup is heavy enough to warrant it.

## Exploring a codebase — graft first, even inside a skill

Skills such as `brainstorming` ("Explore project context — check files,
docs, recent commits") tell you to look around the project. When the
project has a `graft/` index, do that step through graft instead of
listing directories and reading files one by one:
`graft_graft_repo_map` for orientation, `graft_graft_find_code` for "where
is X / how does Y work", `graft_graft_file_api` to skim a file, and
`graft_graft_trace_calls` for callers. Then `read` only the files you are
about to edit. Directory listings and whole-file reads are the fallback
when there is no `graft/` index.

## Verifying UI changes — once, in a real browser

Passing tests is not enough for a change someone will see in a browser (a
web page, a game). Before reporting done, verify it once with
chrome-devtools: load the page, do the one interaction the task is about,
and check the console for errors. Keep it to a handful of calls — a single
short wait for the page to settle, no polling loops. If the page cannot
load or throws, that is a failure to report or fix, not "done".

## Re-reading files after compaction or pruning

When you need a file you already read earlier in this session (its content
was compacted or pruned away), do not re-read the whole file. If the
project has a `graft/` index, run `graft skeleton <file>` or `graft ask
"<symbol>" --source` first; then `read` only the lines you need with
`offset`/`limit`. A full read is fine right before editing a file you
have not read since the last compaction.

## Memory — facts that must outlive this session (memory MCP)

- Before asking the user about a preference or a past decision, call
  `memory_search_nodes` with the project's folder name (and "user") — the
  answer may already be stored.
- When the user states a durable preference, or brainstorming/grilling
  settles a decision that later sessions will need, save it:
  `memory_create_entities` for a new project/user entity, otherwise
  `memory_add_observations` — one short sentence per fact, prefixed with
  today's date (YYYY-MM-DD).
- Never store secrets, code, or anything the repo already records
  (graft, git history, specs under `docs/`).
